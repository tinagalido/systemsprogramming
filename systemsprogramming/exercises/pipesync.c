 * Example of synchronization using a pipe.
 * Author: Sourav Mukherjee (sourav@fdu.edu)
 * 
 * Imagine a parent process P creates two child processes C1 and C2.
 * Each child process must complete two tasks T1 and T2.
 * After C1 and C2 have both completed T1, the parent must print:
 * "All children have completed their first task."
 * After C1 and C2 have completed T2 and called exit, the parent must print:
 * "All children have completed their second task as well."
